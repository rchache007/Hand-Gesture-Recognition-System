# Machine Learning Based Biometric Hand Gesture Analysis

This project introduces a Hand Gesture Recognizer capable of identifying various hand signals like 
smiles, victory signs, peace symbols, fists, and okay signs. We developed the software using Python 
and employed the MediaPipe framework along with OpenCV for the technical side of things. These 
tools help the system understand and interpret different hand gestures accurately. OpenCV handles 
image processing efficiently, ensuring the recognizer works well.
Our project explores how this Hand Gesture Recognizer works, breaking down the roles of the 
MediaPipe framework and OpenCV. The report walks through the design decisions, development 
steps, and the Python code behind it all. By bringing together computer vision, machine learning, 
and Python programming, our work highlights the possibilities these technologies offer in making 
gesture recognition practical and accessible. It serves as a straightforward example for developers 
and researchers interested in similar projects.
